## Future Scope

### Circular Dependencies
- There are circular dependencies between the `ContactsService`, `TagsService`, and `GroupsService`. These have been left as is but should be addressed in future iterations.

### Repository Layer
- While a repository layer isn't necessary right now due to limited queries, it could be considered for better separation of concerns if the complexity grows.

### API Simplification
- The current API is too cluttered with many endpoints. Consider splitting it into a distributed monolith or microservices for better scalability and maintainability.
